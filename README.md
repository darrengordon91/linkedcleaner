# LinkedInCleaner Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension that enhances your LinkedIn feed by allowing you to vote on posts as either "Hot Take ðŸ”¥" or "Hot Turd ðŸ’©". Posts marked as "Hot Turd" will be overlaid with a poop GIF to help you identify low-quality content.

## Features

- Visual poop GIF overlay on posts marked as "Hot Turd"
- Persistent voting state (votes are saved between sessions)
- Clean and unobtrusive UI that integrates with LinkedIn's design
- Works on images and video content
